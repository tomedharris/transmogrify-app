# TMOG

The Universal Text Transformer - [tmog.app](https://tmog.app)

## Introduction

TMOG aims to be a simple-to-use, secure text transformer for developers.

It is written in a mixture of TypeScript with Vue.js, and Go.

It is a bit of a work in progress though I do intend to make regular updates and improvements.
